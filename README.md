## Abstract

In the context of emergency care, timely and informed decision-making is crucial for both clinical and operational efficiency. This work presents a process mining-based framework aimed at supporting healthcare professionals and hospital management in operational decision-making within the Emergency Department (ED). Starting from real, anonymized hospital information system (HIS) data, we construct a structured event log that undergoes data encoding and enrichment. The pipeline applies both traditional process mining techniques and advanced predictive models, including large language models (LLMs), to analyze and forecast patient flow and outcomes. A proof-of-concept dashboard mockup is developed to illustrate how predictive process analytics can be integrated into clinical decision support systems. The approach demonstrates tangible organizational impact and clinical applicability, with active involvement of healthcare stakeholders throughout the validation phase. This contribution underscores the role of computer science in bridging data-driven process insights and actionable healthcare decisions.
