## Abstract

*Background.* Emergency Departments (EDs) are characterized by highly dynamic and variable processes, where gaining timely insight into patient flow and care pathways is essential to support clinical and organizational activities. Process-driven analytical pipelines can contribute to enhancing process visibility and analytical understanding by leveraging routinely collected hospital data in complex healthcare environments.

*Methods.* This study presents a process-driven analytical approach with a general pipeline and its operational realization within a modular application. A proof-of-concept integrates process mining, predictive process monitoring, large language models (LLMs), and explainable artificial intelligence to enable process-aware analysis of Emergency Department data. All components operate within a privacy-preserving, on-premise environment.

*Results.* As a practical instantiation of the general analytical pipeline, the modular application combines process exploration, narrative generation, and demonstrative outcome prediction within a unified dashboard. The results illustrate the construction and enrichment of event logs, the generation of narrative representations from patient trajectories using LLMs, predictive modeling based on both structured features and narrative-based embeddings, and the interpretation of model outputs through explainability techniques. Overall, the demonstrative application indicates the feasibility of integrating heterogeneous analytical techniques within a coherent pipeline to support exploratory and informational analysis of ED processes and patient pathways.

*Conclusion.* The proposed general framework provides analytical understanding of ED workflows without replacing clinical judgment or decision-making responsibility. By integrating predictive analytics, LLM-based representations, and explainability within a single pipeline, the approach establishes a foundation for future extensions toward broader evaluation, additional analytical tasks, and potential operational use in healthcare settings.
